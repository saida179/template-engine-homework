For this assignment I created a software engineering team generator command line application. In this application the user can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team.. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 

### User input

The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.
